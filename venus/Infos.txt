Image Description: “This global view of the surface of Venus is centred at 180 degrees east longitude. Magellan synthetic aperture radar mosaics from the first cycle of Magellan mapping are mapped onto a computer-simulated globe to create this image. Data gaps are filled with Pioneer Venus Orbiter data, or a constant mid-range value. Simulated colour is used to enhance small-scale structure. The simulated hues are based on colour images recorded by the Soviet Venera 13 and 14 spacecraft.”
