Image Description: “About 1000 Viking Orbiter red- and violet-filter images have been processed to provide global colour coverage of Mars at a scale of 1 km/pixel. Note heavy impact cratering of the highlands (bottom and right portions of this mosaic) and the younger, less heavily cratered terrains elsewhere.”
