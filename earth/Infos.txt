EARTH


STORY

I come back down to Earth, but only briefly. I lay down in a rainforest listening to birds and insects singing. I go for a swim. Somehow, there’s no one else around. It starts to rain so I go back into my ship for the night, sleeping soundly. I wake up early and everything is gleaming. And still— I want to leave this Earth behind. The moon is still up in the sky when I head back into space.

NOTES

Earth is an ocean planet, overwhelmingly covered in water. You’ll hear birds and insects (sound emitters themselves) on the weather loop, as well as rain and ocean waves. Every song we know and every sound we know has been made on Earth.

Calculations (by Dr. Conor Nixon) used in the Earth plug-in design:

Surface pressure ‘P’ (bar): 1.000
Surface temperature ’T’ (K): 287
Gas components: Nitrogen (78.08%), Oxygen (20.95%), Argon (0.93%), Water (0.50%), Carbon dioxide (0.04%)
Mean Molecular Weight (g): 29.05
Atmospheric Density ‘rho’ (kg/m3): 1.22
Mean Adiabatic Index (gamma): 1.46
Speed Sound (m/s): 347
Speed Sound Relative to Earth = 1: 100%
Pitch shift of middle ‘C’ (Hz): 261

METHODOLOGY

How might embodied subjects perceive sound waves as they travel through the different atmospheres of our solar system? How would the vibrations of Venus feel to a fleshy form? If we were to put our ears to the ground, or lie down our bodies, would we not feel the Mercuryquakes below the surface? And isn’t feeling sound the epitome of experiencing it? These questions constituted my conversations with scientists and researchers at NASA between 2018 and 2019. 

As I began my research, it was immediately apparent that every planet (except for Mercury) is incredibly windy. My mind was racing, imagining the planets as windy tunnels and reverberant rooms: if I could turn the wind off, what would my voice, or my songs, sound like then? To find out, I had to imagine the interplanetary weather patterns and geographical features as music, as if the thunder clouds and volcanoes were musical instruments in and of themselves. Every planet has its own frequency; if we decide that Earth is middle C (261.63 Hertz), each other planet must also have its own pitch based on its own surface pressure, surface temperature, gas components and atmospheric density.

I relied extensively on calculations made by Dr. Conor Nixon (NASA) while conceptualizing the Sononaut plug-ins. I took some necessary artistic liberties through imaginative and conceptual deliberations made within the coding parameters, or ‘character’ of each plug-in. Complete ‘accuracy’ is impossible because of an inherent lack of knowability so, in this sense, artistic interpretation is used to bridge the gap between data and my own imagination. I also assign superhuman qualities to users, meaning that one of my core assumptions is that we can somehow survive these uninhabitable atmospheres. The Sononaut plug-ins allow artists, scientists, researchers, musicians, and composers alike to control and modify effects that simulate what we would hear if we were listening through extraterrestrial atmospheric conditions— bringing us a little closer to ‘stepping into’ these other worlds.
